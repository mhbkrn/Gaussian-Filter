Gaussian Filter Application

This repository contains a Python application that applies a Gaussian filter to input data using the SciPy library. Smooths input data using a Gaussian filter from the SciPy library. The application has been compiled into an executable using Nuitka for improved performance and distribution.

Usage

Run file GF1.1.exe and browse file using format <p>![screenshot](sampledata.jpg)</p>
Then click process and plot, here the sample for averaging data blood pressure <p>![screenshot](sampleresult.jpg)</p>

The detection of systolic and diastolic pressure is still not accurate and requires further improvements to better accommodate data variations and to obtain more reliable blood pressure data.
